          At <span className="font-semibold">Engineered Tennis</span>, I combine biomechanics, 
          system design principles, and years of coaching experience to help players unlock their 
          highest potential. My philosophy is that tennis improvement isn’t random — it’s engineered.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I’ve coached across all levels: from USTA juniors and high school athletes to college players. 
          My approach focuses on mechanics, discipline, and building a strong technical foundation that lasts.

          Tennis has been a lifelong passion, and this project is about giving players access to 
          high-performance training at an affordable price. Whether your goal is competition or 
          personal growth, I’ll help you develop the tools to succeed.
