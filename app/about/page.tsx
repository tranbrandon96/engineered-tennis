        <p>
          At <span className="font-bold">Engineered Tennis</span>, I combine biomechanics, 
          system design principles, and years of coaching experience to help players unlock 
          their highest potential. My philosophy is that tennis improvement isnâ€™t random â€” itâ€™s engineered.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™ve coached across all levels: from USTA juniors and high school athletes to college players. 
          My approach focuses on mechanics, discipline, and building a strong technical foundation that lasts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tennis has been a lifelong passion, and this project is about giving players access to high-performance 
          training at an affordable price. Whether your goal is competition or personal growth, Iâ€™ll help you 
          develop the tools to succeed.
