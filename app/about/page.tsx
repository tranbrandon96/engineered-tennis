        The Story Behind Engineered Tennis
      </h1>

      {/* Story Section */}
      <div className="max-w-2xl space-y-6 text-base leading-relaxed sm:text-lg">
        <p>
          My name is <span className="font-semibold text-slate-900">Brandon Tran</span> ‚Äî founder and coach of{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold text-emerald-600">Engineered Tennis</span>. I‚Äôve always believed that mastery in tennis
          isn‚Äôt built on endless repetition, but through understanding ‚Äî the mechanics, timing, and flow behind every movement.
        </p>

        <p>
          I currently work as a <span className="font-semibold">Software Engineer</span>, and that technical mindset is the
          foundation of how I coach. The same principles that make great systems ‚Äî clarity, structure, and efficiency ‚Äî are what
          make great athletes. I see tennis as a network of connected parts: footwork, tempo, racquet path, and timing, all
          engineered to work in harmony.
        </p>

        <p>
          What makes my coaching different is my commitment to{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold text-emerald-600">problem solving through mechanics</span>. Most players ‚Äî and even many
          coaches ‚Äî stop at general instruction. I go deeper, identifying the root cause of breakdowns in timing, energy transfer,
          and body coordination. I do the heavy lifting ‚Äî analyzing, refining, and rebuilding so players can finally feel what
          efficient, effortless tennis should be.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the years, I‚Äôve coached players of all levels ‚Äî from young juniors developing strong technical habits to advanced
          athletes refining elite-level mechanics. What started as a passion for understanding motion evolved into a structured
          method that merges engineering logic with human performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold text-emerald-600">Engineered Tennis</span> is built on one principle: improvement isn‚Äôt
          random ‚Äî it‚Äôs designed. Every lesson is structured around precision, feedback, and cause-and-effect learning so players
          understand <em>why</em> their strokes work ‚Äî not just how to hit them.
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal is to help players build a complete foundation ‚Äî not just stronger shots, but smarter decisions, deeper
          confidence, and mechanical awareness that lasts. Whether you‚Äôre a beginner building your first rally or a competitor
          chasing the next level, I‚Äôll help you develop a blueprint for your best tennis ‚Äî one that‚Äôs engineered, tested, and
          entirely your own.

      Federer‚Äôs smoothness, Nadal‚Äôs intensity, and Djokovic‚Äôs precision all influence how I teach balance, rhythm, and purpose in every swing.

      ‚Ä¢ <span className="font-semibold">Dream Goal:</span> One reason I started Engineered Tennis was to one day meet Roger Federer ‚Äî
      not to talk technique, but to understand his mindset, calm under pressure, and on-court mentality.

Steph Curry is my GOAT ‚Äî he represents hard work, discipline, and the quiet confidence that comes from relentless consistency.  
      Another one of my idols is Kobe Bryant ‚Äî his Mamba Mentality taught me that success isn‚Äôt about talent; it‚Äôs about outworking your opponent in every way.  
      Those two mindsets shape how I coach: stay disciplined, stay humble, and always put in the work.
